# AI Assistant Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture and implementation plan for building an AI assistant similar to the one in the existing project. The AI assistant will be capable of code analysis, generation, debugging, and other software development tasks.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Model Manager**
   - Handles loading and interaction with AI models
   - Manages model configuration and parameters
   - Provides a unified interface for text generation

2. **AI Capabilities**
   - Modular system of capabilities (code generation, debugging, etc.)
   - Registry for capability discovery and management
   - Base classes for consistent capability implementation

3. **Configuration System**
   - Centralized configuration management
   - Support for YAML files and environment variables
   - Validation using Pydantic models

4. **Backend API**
   - RESTful API for client communication
   - Endpoints for different AI capabilities
   - Request validation and error handling

5. **Frontend Interface**
   - Chat-based user interface
   - Code display with syntax highlighting
   - Response formatting and rendering

### Data Flow

1. User submits a request through the frontend
2. Request is sent to the backend API
3. Backend identifies the appropriate capability
4. Capability processes the request using the model manager
5. Response is returned to the frontend
6. Frontend displays the formatted response

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

1. Set up the model manager
   - Implement model loading and configuration
   - Add support for different model providers
   - Create text generation interface

2. Create the capability system
   - Define base capability classes
   - Implement capability registry
   - Create initial capabilities (code generation, debugging)

3. Implement configuration system
   - Create configuration models
   - Add support for YAML and environment variables
   - Implement validation

### Phase 2: Backend Development

1. Set up the API server
   - Create RESTful endpoints
   - Implement request validation
   - Add error handling

2. Implement code analysis
   - Create parsers for different languages
   - Implement error detection
   - Add fix suggestion generation

3. Add additional capabilities
   - Test generation
   - Documentation
   - Refactoring

### Phase 3: Frontend Development

1. Create the chat interface
   - Implement message display
   - Add user input handling
   - Create message formatting

2. Add code display
   - Implement syntax highlighting
   - Add copy functionality
   - Create diff view for code changes

3. Implement response rendering
   - Format different response types
   - Add support for markdown
   - Create interactive elements

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- Python for core AI functionality
- FastAPI or Flask for API server
- Transformers library for model integration
- Pydantic for data validation

### Frontend
- React for UI components
- Axios for API communication
- Prism or Highlight.js for code highlighting
- Markdown-it for markdown rendering

### AI Models
- OpenAI GPT models (GPT-4, etc.)
- Hugging Face models (optional)
- Local models (optional)

## Deployment

1. Development environment
   - Local development server
   - Mock AI responses for testing

2. Production environment
   - Containerized deployment with Docker
   - API key management
   - Rate limiting and usage tracking

## Future Enhancements

1. Support for additional languages
2. Integration with version control systems
3. Project-wide analysis and recommendations
4. Custom model fine-tuning
5. Collaborative features for team development
