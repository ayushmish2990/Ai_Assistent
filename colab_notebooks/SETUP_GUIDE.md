# 🎯 Setup Guide: Choosing the Right Approach

This guide helps you choose between different setup approaches based on your needs and experience level.

## 🤔 Which Approach Should I Choose?

### 🎓 **Minimal Setup** (Recommended for Beginners)

**Best for:**
- Learning AI model training
- Experimenting with different models
- Quick prototyping
- Students and researchers
- When you only need model training capabilities

**What you get:**
- Essential ML libraries only
- Focused model training pipeline
- No complex backend setup
- Faster installation and setup
- Lower resource usage

**Files you need:**
- `requirements_minimal.txt`
- `02_Custom_Model_Training.ipynb`
- `05_Colab_Utilities.ipynb`

---

### 🏗️ **Full Setup** (For Production Use)

**Best for:**
- Production deployments
- Complete application migration
- Team development
- When you need full API functionality
- Integration with existing systems

**What you get:**
- Complete backend infrastructure
- API endpoints and web services
- Multiple AI provider support
- Advanced monitoring and logging
- Full development toolkit

**Files you need:**
- All notebooks in the collection
- Full `requirements.txt`
- Backend and frontend components

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### For Minimal Setup:
```python
# In Google Colab
!wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/colab_notebooks/requirements_minimal.txt
!pip install -r requirements_minimal.txt

# Then open: 02_Custom_Model_Training.ipynb
```

### For Full Setup:
```python
# In Google Colab
!wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/requirements.txt
!pip install -r requirements.txt

# Then open: 01_AI_Assistant_Migration.ipynb
```

## 🔄 Migration Path

You can always start with the **Minimal Setup** and upgrade later:

1. **Start Minimal**: Learn model training basics
2. **Experiment**: Try different models and techniques
3. **Upgrade**: When ready for production, use full setup
4. **Deploy**: Integrate trained models into full application

## 💡 Recommendations

### 👨‍🎓 **If you're new to AI/ML:**
- Start with Minimal Setup
- Focus on understanding model training
- Experiment with different datasets
- Learn the fundamentals first

### 👨‍💼 **If you're building for production:**
- Use Full Setup from the beginning
- Plan your architecture carefully
- Consider scalability and maintenance
- Set up proper monitoring and logging

### 🔬 **If you're doing research:**
- Minimal Setup is usually sufficient
- Focus on model experimentation
- Use wandb for experiment tracking
- Upgrade only if you need API access
