## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Environment Variables

Set these in your Colab notebook for enhanced functionality:

```python
# API Configuration
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = 'your-api-key'
os.environ['HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN'] = 'your-hf-token'

# Ngrok Configuration
os.environ['NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN'] = 'your-ngrok-token'

# Custom Model Settings
os.environ['MODEL_NAME'] = 'your-custom-model'
os.environ['MAX_TOKENS'] = '2048'
```

### GPU Optimization

```python
# Enable mixed precision training
import torch
torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True

# Optimize memory usage
torch.cuda.empty_cache()
```

### Custom Data Sources

```python
# Mount Google Drive
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

# Configure custom data paths
DATA_PATH = '/content/drive/MyDrive/ai_assistant_data'
MODEL_PATH = '/content/drive/MyDrive/ai_assistant_models'
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 🔴 "Runtime disconnected" Error
**Solution**: 
- Save your work frequently
- Use shorter training sessions
- Consider upgrading to Colab Pro

#### 🔴 "Out of memory" Error
**Solution**:
```python
# Reduce batch size
BATCH_SIZE = 2  # Instead of 8

# Use gradient checkpointing
model.gradient_checkpointing_enable()

# Clear cache regularly
torch.cuda.empty_cache()
```

#### 🔴 "Module not found" Error
**Solution**:
```python
# Install missing packages
!pip install -q package-name

# Restart runtime if needed
# Runtime → Restart runtime
```

#### 🔴 Ngrok Connection Issues
**Solution**:
- Check your ngrok auth token
- Ensure ports are not blocked
- Try different port numbers

### Performance Issues

#### Slow Model Loading
```python
# Use model caching
from transformers import AutoModel
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('model-name', cache_dir='/content/cache')
```

#### High Memory Usage
```python
# Monitor memory usage
import psutil
print(f"Memory usage: {psutil.virtual_memory().percent}%")

# Use model quantization
from transformers import BitsAndBytesConfig
quant_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_8bit=True)
```

## 📈 Performance Tips

### 🚀 Speed Optimization

1. **Use GPU Runtime**
   - Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU

2. **Enable High-RAM**
   - Runtime → Change runtime type → High-RAM

3. **Optimize Data Loading**
   ```python
   # Use DataLoader with multiple workers
   from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
   loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, num_workers=2)
   ```

4. **Cache Frequently Used Models**
   ```python
   # Cache models in session
   if 'model' not in globals():
       model = load_model()
   ```

### 💾 Memory Optimization

1. **Clear Variables**
   ```python
   # Delete large variables when done
   del large_variable
   import gc
   gc.collect()
   ```

2. **Use Gradient Accumulation**
   ```python
   # Instead of large batch sizes
   accumulation_steps = 4
   effective_batch_size = batch_size * accumulation_steps
   ```

3. **Monitor Resource Usage**
   ```python
   # Check GPU memory
   !nvidia-smi
   
   # Check RAM usage
   !free -h
   ```

### 🔄 Workflow Optimization

1. **Save Checkpoints Frequently**
   ```python
   # Save model checkpoints
   torch.save(model.state_dict(), '/content/drive/MyDrive/checkpoint.pth')
   ```

2. **Use Version Control**
   ```python
   # Clone your repository
   !git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

3. **Automate Common Tasks**
   ```python
   # Create utility functions
   def setup_environment():
       # Your setup code here
       pass
   ```
